## Description

This pilot project is for tracking "donation box" that has various goods, such as toothpaste, soap, and snack, in a unit. Goods are donated by any organizations (=members), and packed in donation boxes by a nonprofit foundation (=foundation), and distributed to local welfare centers (=recipients). Each donation box has a unique identification number that allows recipients to record its status into the Klaytn, especially whether a good is arrived at recipients and where it is finally given.
