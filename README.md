## Description

This pilot project is for tracking "donation box" that has various goods, such as toothpaste, soap, and snack, in a unit. Goods are donated by any organizations (=members), and packed in donation boxes by a nonprofit foundation (=foundation), and distributed to local welfare centers (=recipients). Each donation box has a unique identification number that allows recipients to record its status into the Klaytn, especially whether a good is arrived at recipients and where it is finally given. Through the identification numbers, not only members but also the foundation can retrieve the information of goods and boxes when they want.
